            <h2>About the ASPCA</h2>
            The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
            (ASPCA) was the first humane society to be established in North
            America and is, today, one of the largest in the world. Our
            organization was founded by Henry Bergh in 1866 on the belief that
            animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands
            of humans, and must be protected under the law. Headquartered in
            New York City, the ASPCA maintains a strong local presence, and
            with programs that extend our anti-cruelty mission across the
            country, we are recognized as a national animal welfare
            organization. We are a privately funded 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
            corporation, and proud to boast more than 1 million supporters
            across the country.
            <p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>


            <p>As the first humane organization to be granted legal authority
            to investigate and make arrests for crimes against animals, we are
            wholly dedicated to fulfilling the ASPCA mission through nonviolent
            approaches. Our organization providingides local and national
            leadership in three key areas: caring for pet parents and pets,
            providing positive outcomes for at-risk animals and serving victims
            of animal cruelty. For more on our work in each of these areas,
            please visit our programs and services page.</p>


            <h2>Mission</h2>


            <p>The ASPCA's mission, as stated by Henry Bergh in 1866, is "to
            provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals
            throughout the United States."</p>


            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Incorporated in 1866 by a special act of the New York State
            legislature, the ASPCA has a history rich in challenges and
            victoriesâ€”from providing care and protection for the city's working
            horses and transforming dog pounds into professionally run
            adoptions facilities to founding an animal hospital that is still
            running today.
            </p>

            <p>New York City, April 1866: The driver of a cart laden with coal
            is whipping his horse. Passersby on the New York City street stop
            to gawk not so much at the weak, emaciated equine, but at the tall
            man, elegant in top hat and spats, who is explaining to the driver
            that it is now against the law to beat one's animal. Thus, America
            first encounters "The Great Meddler."</p>


            <p><img alt="Henry" src=
            "http://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium_image_300x200/public/field/image/history.jpg?itok=SErWESq_"
            style="float:right; margin: 0 20pxpx 10px 30px;">Henry Bergh was
            born in 1813, the son of a prominent shipbuilder. His adult years
            found him to be a man of leisure, dabbling in the arts and touring
            Europe. As was befitting the life of an aristocrat, in 1863 he was
            appointed to a diplomatic post at the Russian court of Czar
            Alexander II. It was there he first took action against man's
            inhumanity toward animals. Soon after, en route to America, he
            stopped in London to crib notes from the Earl of Harrowby,
            president of England's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
            to Animals, founded in 1840.</p>


            <p>Back in New York, Bergh pleaded on behalf of "these mute
            servants of mankind" at a February 8, 1866, meeting at Clinton
            Hall. According to the next day's edition of The Sun Bergh
            impressed attendees with his indignant recollection of a family
            watching a bullfight in Spain who "...seemed to receive their most
            ecstatic throb from the maddening stab of the horned animal." Bergh
            then detailed practices in America, including cockfighting and the
            horrors of slaughterhouses.</p>


            <p>A basic tenet of Bergh's philosophy, protecting animals was an
            issue that crossed party lines and class boundaries. To his
            audience, which included some of Manhattan's most powerful business
            and government leaders, he stressed, "This is a matter purely of
            conscience; it has no perplexing side issues. It is a moral
            question in all its aspects."</p>


            <h2>Four Paws and 149 Years Ago...</h2>


            <p>Fortified by the success of his speech and the number of
            dignitaries to sign his "Declaration of the Rights of Animals,"
            Bergh brought a charter for a proposed society to protect animals
            to the New York State Legislature. With his flair for drama he
            convinced politicians and committees of his purpose, and the
            charter incorporating the American Society for the Prevention of
            Cruelty to Animals was passed on April 10, 1866. Nine days later,
            an anti-cruelty law was passed, and the ASPCA granted the right to
            enforce it.</p>


            <p>That is exactly what the ASPCA, with a full-time staff of three,
            set out to do. Bergh wrote to a reporter, "Day after day I am in
            slaughterhouses, or lying in wait at midnight with a squad of
            police near some dog pit. Lifting a fallen horse to his feet,
            penetrating buildings where I inspect collars and saddles for raw
            flesh, then lecturing in public schools to children, and again to
            adult societies. Thus my whole life is spent."</p>


            <p>The comforts Bergh gained for creatures just during his lifetime
            are enormous in scope. In 1867, the ASPCA operated the first
            ambulance anywhere for injured horses; 1875 marked the creation of
            a sling for horse rescue. Bergh advocated humane alternatives to
            live pigeons at shooting events, and supplied the horses who pulled
            carts and streetcars in Manhattan with fresh drinking water daily.
            These public fountains were visited by cats, dogs and humans,
            too.</p>


            <p>By the time of Bergh's death in 1888, the idea that animals
            should be protected from cruelty had touched America's heart and
            conscience. Humane societies had sprung up throughout the
            nation-among the first to follow New York's lead were Buffalo,
            Boston and San Francisco-and 37 of 38 states in the union had
            enacted anti-cruelty laws. Working for legislation continues to be
            one of our foremost priorities.</p>


            <h2>All in a Dog's Work?</h2>


            <p>Although the ASPCA's early efforts focused on horses and
            livestock, the society worked for cats and dogs, too. Some cases
            were prosecuted. As published in the ASPCA's first annual report in
            1867, David Heath was sentenced to 10 days in prison for beating a
            cat to death. Upon hearing the verdict, "he remarked that the
            arresting officer ought to be disemboweled," at which point a $25
            fine was added to his punishment.</p>
            <img alt="cat" src=
            "http://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium_image_300x200/public/field/image/blog/potw-raymond_091015_feature.jpg?itok=OMRKFfa4"
            style="float:left; margin: 0 35px 1px 0;">

            <p>In the late 1800s blue-collar canines were used to turn
            treadmills and pull small carts, most often for men who could not
            afford a horse. In many cases, the dog's "owners" provided no food
            or shelter, leaving the animal to scavenge in garbage cans. In
            1867, Bergh helped pass a law that prohibited the use of dogs to
            pull carts without a license.</p>


            <p>Canines seemed to be most cruelly exploited as prize fighters.
            As the headline in an article appearing in the Long Island Star,
            December 8, 1876, read, "Two Bull Dogs Chew Each Other Up."
            Attended by prominent betting men, the $1,000 championship fight
            lasted nearly four hours.</p>


            <p>The ASPCA waged an all-out war on the day's most famous
            "sportsman," Kit Burns; on one occasion evoking high drama, Bergh
            dropped through a skylight into Burns' pit. The battle was
            frequently frustrating, as judges read the law regarding dog
            fighting quite narrowly, making it almost impossible to convict
            someone unless they had been caught setting the dogs at each other
            or instigating the fight.</p>


            <h2>Catch as Kindness Can</h2>


            <p><img alt="dog" src=
            "http://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium_image_300x200/public/field/image/blog/blog_apcc-chat_060415_feature.jpg?itok=PYXgTDXD"
            style="float:right; margin: 0 20pxpx 10px 30px;">In the early days
            of the ASPCA, the "average dog on the street" was just that-on the
            street. No one knows for sure the number of strays to call
            Manhattan home, but as many as 300 were rounded up daily and thrown
            into a cage, which was then swung into the East River, the animals
            drowned. Newspapers depicted city dog catchers as a frightful lot.
            As they were paid by the dog, not the hour, some were known to
            steal animals from owners' yards. The city-run shelter in Brooklyn
            was operated, as described in The World, June 23, 1887, "In a
            manner greatly detrimental to the public health and the dogs are
            treated in a most inhumane manner."</p>


            <p>The abuses grew so flagrant city-wide as to demand immediate
            checking, and in 1894 the Society was placed in charge of New York
            City's animal control duties-picking up lost, stray or injured
            animals and maintaining shelters. To cover expenses, the ASPCA
            collected revenues generated from dog licensing fees.</p>


            <p>The public was so pleased with the ASPCA's performance that in
            1895 the law was amended and a second shelter established in
            Brooklyn, followed by one in Staten Island. Brooklyn's Sunday
            Advertiser, May 12, 1895, reported that "The business is now
            conducted on kind and merciful principles, and even the "Wandering
            Willie" of dodgem will be treated with consideration...." If an
            animal went unclaimed, a more humane method of euthanasia,
            suffocation via gas chamber, was implemented. Cats were written
            into the law, but they were ubiquitous at the time, occupying a
            shadow land between ownership and a wild state.</p>


            <p>On January 1, 1995, the ASPCA's contract to provide animal
            control for the city of New York expired, and a decision was made
            not to renew. The job had drained the Society's resources; even in
            1963, as reported in Animal Protection, the ASPCA was "steadily
            losing money since 1956." But over the course of the 100-year
            contract, the ASPCA had made notable improvements: In 1928, the
            per-capita euthanasia rate was 511 dogs and cats for every 10,000
            people; by 1994, the rate dropped to 53 per 10,000 people, ranking
            New York City as one of the best among major U.S. cities.</p>


            <h2>The Medicine Show</h2>


            <p>At the turn of the century, the ASPCA shifted focus from horses
            and livestock to small animals. This phenomenon is echoed in the
            veterinary profession, which had its roots in agriculture and meat
            industries. Harvard University's veterinary hospital was opened in
            1884; most of the patients were horses. The hospital actually
            closed in 1904, under the assumption that its necessity would
            diminish as people swapped horses for cars-but veterinarians did
            treat dogs and cats in the early 1900s.</p>


            <p>Setting the pace for others, the ASPCA opened a hospital for
            animals in 1912. ASPCA doctors helped develop the use of anesthesia
            in 1918; that same year, they operated on a horse with a broken
            kneecap-a procedure considered a mere possibility at the time. In
            1954, the hospital added pathology and radiograph laboratories, and
            in 1961 ASPCA veterinarians performed their first open-heart
            surgery on a dog.</p>


            <p>Until the mid-20th century, diseases such as distemper and
            panleukopenia cost countless animals their lives, but advances in
            preventive medicine helped change this. According to a 1963 article
            in ASPCA Animal Protection, "Ten years ago the tide of...dread
            virus diseases engulfed millions of puppies and kittens. Today they
            are slowly being wiped out by vaccines."</p>


            <h2>So Nice to Come home to</h2>


            <p>Between the 1950s and 1960s, pet care in America had made so
            much progress that the average life expectancy of cats and dogs had
            increased by two to three years. According to Andrew Rowan, Ph.D.,
            director of Tufts University Medical School's Center for Animals
            and Public Policy, "Pet ownership as we know it today is a
            post-World War II phenomenon." Canned food made it easier for many
            people to keep animals; cat ownership increased tremendously with
            the development of kitty litter.</p>


            <p>This trend helped to change the focus of the Society's work, and
            sheltering and adopting programs were greatly expanded. In 1896,
            654 dogs and 163 cats were adopted from ASPCA shelters; now that
            number is annually in the thousands.</p>


            <p>An increase in companion animal caretaking brought with it the
            need for well-behaved companion animals, and in 1944 the ASPCA
            instituted a nine-week dog training class that, according to
            promotional literature, "not only makes the dog obedient, but
            results in a closer companionship between dog and owner, when the
            latter realizes the responsibility of having a pet." Today, the
            Animal Behavior Center provides obedience classes, training for
            visiting dogs and a Behavior Hotline open to callers around the
            country.</p>

            <p>Making sure one's dog wore a license was a predicate of
            responsible pet ownership, and every spring local newspapers
            carried notices informing owners to renew before April 30. In 1963,
            the Society employed 25 uniformed officers, each assigned to one
            area in the city, to enforce the law. Licenses could be lost,
            though, and some owners opted for the permanent, painless
            Identacode, whereby an indelible number was tattooed on an animal's
            leg with an electric device. Instituted by the ASPCA in 1948, the
            procedure seems a precursor to a method developed in the mid-1980s,
            in which a tiny, numbered microchip is inserted under the skin.
            Should the animal become lost, a facility with a scanner can
            identify him or her immediately. Since 1993, the ASPCA has been
            implanting dogs and cats with microchips.</p>


            <h2>Unlucky Numbers</h2>


            <p>As people opened their homes to cats and dogs, controlling the
            rate at which the animals reproduced became a growing problem. An
            article in Animal Protection, Winter 1964, reports, "The truth is
            there aren't enough homes in the United States for all the puppies
            and kittens born each year." The article detailed the Society's
            plan to promote spay/neuter operations and offer free sterilization
            surgeries to financially hard-pressed owners.</p>


            <p>Although actively endorsing sterilization since the late 1950s,
            the ASPCA did not always believe the practice should be mandatory.
            As explained in the 1963 annual report, "Many owners don't want the
            operation performed for religious, biological, or other reasons..."
            By 1972, however, the ASPCA Placement program was promoting
            spay/neuter for adopted animals. While many groups, including the
            ASPCA, have tried to push spay/neuter since the 1960s, even today
            they grapple with the problem of owner compliance.</p>


            <h2>Back to the Furure</h2>


            <p>As executors of Bergh's legacy work in the 21st century, The
            Great Meddler's influence is stronger than ever. As written in The
            Citizen, March 13, 1888, upon Bergh's death: "...so firm a hold did
            he take on the public sense of right that it is impossible that his
            work shall not be continued. he has made too many converts to
            render it all likely that his commonwealth will ever relapse into a
            condition to witness cruelty to animals without resentment." More
            than 125 years later, the words still ring true.</p>
