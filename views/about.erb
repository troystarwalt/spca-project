            <h2>About the ASPCA</h2>
            The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
            (ASPCA) was the first humane society to be established in North
            America and is, today, one of the largest in the world. Our
            organization was founded by Henry Bergh in 1866 on the belief that
            animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands
            of humans, and must be protected under the law. Headquartered in
            New York City, the ASPCA maintains a strong local presence, and
            with programs that extend our anti-cruelty mission across the
            country, we are recognized as a national animal welfare
            organization. We are a privately funded 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
            corporation, and proud to boast more than 1 million supporters
            across the country.
            <p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>


            <p>As the first humane organization to be granted legal authority
            to investigate and make arrests for crimes against animals, we are
            wholly dedicated to fulfilling the ASPCA mission through nonviolent
            approaches. Our organization providingides local and national
            leadership in three key areas: caring for pet parents and pets,
            providing positive outcomes for at-risk animals and serving victims
            of animal cruelty. For more on our work in each of these areas,
            please visit our programs and services page.</p>


            <h2>Mission</h2>


            <p>The ASPCA's mission, as stated by Henry Bergh in 1866, is "to
            provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals
            throughout the United States."</p>


            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Incorporated in 1866 by a special act of the New York State
            legislature, the ASPCA has a history rich in challenges and
            victoriesâ€”from providing care and protection for the city's working
            horses and transforming dog pounds into professionally run
            adoptions facilities to founding an animal hospital that is still
            running today.
            </p>

            <p>New York City, April 1866: The driver of a cart laden with coal
            is whipping his horse. Passersby on the New York City street stop
            to gawk not so much at the weak, emaciated equine, but at the tall
            man, elegant in top hat and spats, who is explaining to the driver
            that it is now against the law to beat one's animal. Thus, America
            first encounters "The Great Meddler."</p>


            <p><img alt="Henry" src=
            "http://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium_image_300x200/public/field/image/history.jpg?itok=SErWESq_"
            style="float:right; margin: 0 20pxpx 10px 30px;">Henry Bergh was
            born in 1813, the son of a prominent shipbuilder. His adult years
            found him to be a man of leisure, dabbling in the arts and touring
            Europe. As was befitting the life of an aristocrat, in 1863 he was
            appointed to a diplomatic post at the Russian court of Czar
            Alexander II. It was there he first took action against man's
            inhumanity toward animals. Soon after, en route to America, he
            stopped in London to crib notes from the Earl of Harrowby,
            president of England's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
            to Animals, founded in 1840.</p>


            <p>Back in New York, Bergh pleaded on behalf of "these mute
            servants of mankind" at a February 8, 1866, meeting at Clinton
            Hall. According to the next day's edition of The Sun Bergh
            impressed attendees with his indignant recollection of a family
            watching a bullfight in Spain who "...seemed to receive their most
            ecstatic throb from the maddening stab of the horned animal." Bergh
            then detailed practices in America, including cockfighting and the
            horrors of slaughterhouses.</p>


            <p>A basic tenet of Bergh's philosophy, protecting animals was an
            issue that crossed party lines and class boundaries. To his
            audience, which included some of Manhattan's most powerful business
            and government leaders, he stressed, "This is a matter purely of
            conscience; it has no perplexing side issues. It is a moral
            question in all its aspects."</p>


            <h2>Four Paws and 149 Years Ago...</h2>


            <p>Fortified by the success of his speech and the number of
            dignitaries to sign his "Declaration of the Rights of Animals,"
            Bergh brought a charter for a proposed society to protect animals
            to the New York State Legislature. With his flair for drama he
            convinced politicians and committees of his purpose, and the
            charter incorporating the American Society for the Prevention of
            Cruelty to Animals was passed on April 10, 1866. Nine days later,
            an anti-cruelty law was passed, and the ASPCA granted the right to
            enforce it.</p>


            <p>That is exactly what the ASPCA, with a full-time staff of three,
            set out to do. Bergh wrote to a reporter, "Day after day I am in
            slaughterhouses, or lying in wait at midnight with a squad of
            police near some dog pit. Lifting a fallen horse to his feet,
            penetrating buildings where I inspect collars and saddles for raw
            flesh, then lecturing in public schools to children, and again to
            adult societies. Thus my whole life is spent."</p>


            <p>The comforts Bergh gained for creatures just during his lifetime
            are enormous in scope. In 1867, the ASPCA operated the first
            ambulance anywhere for injured horses; 1875 marked the creation of
            a sling for horse rescue. Bergh advocated humane alternatives to
            live pigeons at shooting events, and supplied the horses who pulled
            carts and streetcars in Manhattan with fresh drinking water daily.
            These public fountains were visited by cats, dogs and humans,
            too.</p>


            <p>By the time of Bergh's death in 1888, the idea that animals
            should be protected from cruelty had touched America's heart and
            conscience. Humane societies had sprung up throughout the
            nation-among the first to follow New York's lead were Buffalo,
            Boston and San Francisco-and 37 of 38 states in the union had
            enacted anti-cruelty laws. Working for legislation continues to be
            one of our foremost priorities.</p>


            <h2>All in a Dog's Work?</h2>


            <p>Although the ASPCA's early efforts focused on horses and
            livestock, the society worked for cats and dogs, too. Some cases
            were prosecuted. As published in the ASPCA's first annual report in
            1867, David Heath was sentenced to 10 days in prison for beating a
            cat to death. Upon hearing the verdict, "he remarked that the
            arresting officer ought to be disemboweled," at which point a $25
            fine was added to his punishment.</p>
            <img alt="cat" src=
            "http://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium_image_300x200/public/field/image/blog/potw-raymond_091015_feature.jpg?itok=OMRKFfa4"
            style="float:left; margin: 0 35px 1px 0;">

            <p>In the late 1800s blue-collar canines were used to turn
            treadmills and pull small carts, most often for men who could not
            afford a horse. In many cases, the dog's "owners" provided no food
            or shelter, leaving the animal to scavenge in garbage cans. In
            1867, Bergh helped pass a law that prohibited the use of dogs to
            pull carts without a license.</p>


            <p>Canines seemed to be most cruelly exploited as prize fighters.
            As the headline in an article appearing in the Long Island Star,
            December 8, 1876, read, "Two Bull Dogs Chew Each Other Up."
            Attended by prominent betting men, the $1,000 championship fight
            lasted nearly four hours.</p>


            <p>The ASPCA waged an all-out war on the day's most famous
            "sportsman," Kit Burns; on one occasion evoking high drama, Bergh
            dropped through a skylight into Burns' pit. The battle was
            frequently frustrating, as judges read the law regarding dog
            fighting quite narrowly, making it almost impossible to convict
            someone unless they had been caught setting the dogs at each other
            or instigating the fight.</p>


            <h2>Catch as Kindness Can</h2>


            <p><img alt="dog" src=
            "http://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium_image_300x200/public/field/image/blog/blog_apcc-chat_060415_feature.jpg?itok=PYXgTDXD"
            style="float:right; margin: 0 20pxpx 10px 30px;">In the early days
            of the ASPCA, the "average dog on the street" was just that-on the
            street. No one knows for sure the number of strays to call
            Manhattan home, but as many as 300 were rounded up daily and thrown
            into a cage, which was then swung into the East River, the animals
            drowned. Newspapers depicted city dog catchers as a frightful lot.
            As they were paid by the dog, not the hour, some were known to
            steal animals from owners' yards. The city-run shelter in Brooklyn
            was operated, as described in The World, June 23, 1887, "In a
            manner greatly detrimental to the public health and the dogs are
            treated in a most inhumane manner."</p>
